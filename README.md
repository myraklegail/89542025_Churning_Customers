Customer Churn Prediction Deep Learning Application
Overview


Project Overview
In the course of this project, I crafted an extensive deep learning application with the specific goal of forecasting customer churn for telecommunications operators. The issue of customer churn presents a substantial hurdle for businesses, particularly within the telecommunications industry, directly influencing revenue streams. The central aim of this endeavor is to support telecom operators in the proactive identification of customers who are at a higher likelihood of churning.

Feature Extraction and EDA
I began by extracting relevant features from the provided dataset, focusing on aspects that could define customer churn. Through an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), I explored customer profiles or column features related to churn, identifying patterns, and correlations within the dataset.

Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Model using Functional API
For predictive modeling, I employed a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model designed using the Functional API in Keras. This approach provided the flexibility to create a sophisticated neural network architecture tailored to the specific requirements of predicting customer churn.

Model Evaluation
Following the training of the MLP model on the dataset, a thorough assessment of its performance was conducted. Metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and the AUC score were computed to guarantee a comprehensive evaluation of the model's predictive capabilities.

Conclusion
The culmination of this deep learning application signifies a substantial advancement in tackling the complexities associated with customer churn. Through the integration of feature-rich modeling and a user-friendly deployment approach, this project delivers a valuable instrument for telecom operators to actively strategize and manage customer retention efforts.
